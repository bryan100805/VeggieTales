This project aim to develop a Deep Learning models that is able to predict the vegetable classes based on the images uploaded and the model selected (i.e. CNN 31x31 and CNN 128x128) by the users.
With the help of tensorflow-serving and docker, the models will be served in production environment and containerized with their dependencies. Lastly, the model has been deployed on Render so users are able to enjoy the full features of the models to help to make predictions.
